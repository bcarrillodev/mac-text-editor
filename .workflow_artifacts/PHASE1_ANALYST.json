    "user_story": "As a macOS user, I want a simple text editor where I can edit multiple files in tabs with auto-save capabilities so that my work is never lost, even after unexpected app closure or system shutdown.",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "User can open/create multiple text files in tabbed interface",
      "Each tab displays filename and content",
      "Editor displays line numbers for each line in the document",
      "Editor auto-saves file content to persistent storage every 5-30 seconds",
      "Editor persists current session state (open tabs, active tab, cursor positions)",
      "On app restart, all previously open tabs are restored with cursor positions",
      "No syntax highlighting; plain text only",
      "User can manually save (Cmd+S) or auto-save handles it",
      "Editor handles new unsaved files appropriately"

      "Syntax highlighting",
